# PUBGM-Achievement-Tracker

An application to track you achievements in PUBG Mobile.

It extends upon the in-game achievement menu by adding information and tips on how to complete
each achievement, as well as being able to check off the achievements you plan to complete
but are still in progress.

I made this as a project to learn how to develop GUI's, as well as have some coding practice
while I was taking the summer off.

Developed in Python using PIL and Tkinter libraries.
