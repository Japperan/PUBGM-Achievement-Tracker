# PUBGM-Achievement-Tracker

An application to track you achievements in PUBG Mobile.

It extends upon the in-game achievement menu by adding information and statistics, tips on how to complete
each achievement, and the ability to check off the achievements you plan to complete that are still in progress.

HOW TO DOWNLOAD

App will only work on Windows

1. Download is in the releases section which should be on the right of the screen. You're going to want to click on the 
release there, and then make sure you download PUBGM_Achievement_Tracker.zip from it.

2. You'll need to unzip the file using a program like WinRAR. You can place the app contents anywhere, just dont mess 
with how the files are organized.

3. You can run the app by clicking "PUBGM Achievement Tracker.exe", which is located at the top of the file hierarchy.
It takes a couple seconds to load on my computer, so don't worry if that happens.

4. If you want to create a desktop shortcut, you can do so by right clicking on the .exe file, clicking on "send to",
and select "Desktop".

The main thing this app needs is achievement descriptions! If you want to help provide tips and tricks, contact me 
so we can get everything set up. Anything in the issues tab needs contributingas well, so if you feel confident with
your coding skills feel free to solve some of the issues. But for now, I just really need people to add achievement 
data.

I made this as a project to learn how to develop GUI's, as well as have some coding practice
while I was taking the summer off.

Developed in Python using PIL and Tkinter libraries.
