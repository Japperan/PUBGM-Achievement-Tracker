# PUBGM-Achievement-Tracker

An application to track you achievements in PUBG Mobile.

It extends upon the in-game achievement menu by adding information and statistics, tips on how to complete
each achievement, and the ability to check off the achievements you plan to complete that are still in progress. 

Browse through achievements:

Contributing:

I have moved on to other projects, so the project is now open for others to contribute. Anything in the issues tab
needs contributing, but the main thing needed right now is descriptions for each achievement.

I made this as a project to learn how to develop GUI's, as well as have some coding practice
while I was taking the summer off.

Developed in Python using PIL and Tkinter libraries.
