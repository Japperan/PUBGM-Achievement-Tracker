      "info": "The Chicken Expert achievement is challenging, but not impossible. The trickiest weapons to use for the final kill are the pistol, crossbow, melee weapon, and vehicle. It's recommended for this to stay in Platinum V, which is the lowest allowable league for this achievement.\n\nFor the pistol kill I would recommend using the P18C. The easiest way to get a final kill with a pistol is to first damage the enemy with your main weapon, then pull out your sidearm and finish them off.\n\nThe crossbow is another tricky weapon since the bolts will start dropping after 45m. Crossbows are a one-hit-kill if it's a headshot, so you'll have to aim for the enemies head. An alternative is to damage the enemy first with your main weapon, and then finish with the crossbow, but this is less effective since the enemy will likely start moving after being fired on. Sanhok is a good map for getting this final kill. With all the long grass around, enemies are more likely to prone in the grass in the final circle, which presents a good opportunity for you to aim for the head while they lie still. The long grass will also help you sneak up on the enemy. The enemy won't hear you crawling through the grass if it's over 5m, and so this is a good way to get behind the enemy without them realizing.\n\nFor the pan, bring at least 6 smoke grenades into the final circle. Ideally the circle will be inside a building, but this strategy can still work out in the open. When you get down to the last enemy, start throwing smoke grenades your smoke grenades into the circle. Wait until the enemy is in the smoke, then run in with your pan and end them!\n\nThe last difficult weapon to get a kill with is a vehicle. I recommend trying this on Erangel since it has the most open, flat terrain. First you'll want to secure a vehicle, preferably a UAZ since this has the most maneuverablity. Make sure to keep your vehicle as undamaged as possible until the final circle, so don't drive around when you don't have to. If the last enemy is behind cover it'll be hard to run them over, so try waiting until they have to run in the open to make your move."
